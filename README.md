# COVID19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
Project Overview
In this project, I will preprocess and merge datasets to calculate necessary measures and prepare them for analysis. I will be working with two primary datasets:

COVID-19 Dataset: Published by John Hopkins University, this dataset contains the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per day for each country.
World Happiness Report Dataset: This dataset includes various life factors scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
The goal is to merge these datasets to explore the potential relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and the happiness of its inhabitants.

Project Objectives
Preprocess the COVID-19 and World Happiness datasets.
Merge the datasets based on country names.
Calculate relevant measures to facilitate analysis.
Investigate the relationship between COVID-19 spread and the happiness of people in different countries.
